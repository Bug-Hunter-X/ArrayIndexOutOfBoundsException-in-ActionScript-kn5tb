# ActionScript ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript: attempting to access an array element beyond its valid index range.  The `bug.as` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access the element at the index equal to the array's length.  The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version.
